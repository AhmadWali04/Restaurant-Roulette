# Restaurant-Roulette
A web app I built to learn how to handle API's, react with databases (Supabase) &amp; learn front end. The project helps curious people find a restaurant near them to eat, filtering by their preferences.
## Project Strengths
This project shows my strong understanding of Software Engineering and the documentation skills that must be developed. For each component, there are use case, entity-relationship, boundary-control, UML and class diagrams to highlight how the code is operating at each given point in time.
