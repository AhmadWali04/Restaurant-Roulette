# Restaurant-Roulette
A web app I built to learn how to handle API's, react with databases (Supabase) &amp; learn front end. The project helps curious people find a a restaurant near them to eat, filtering by their preferences.

This project is a course project, where I also display my understanding of a responsive code base by developing diagrams, documentation and presentations to show different use cases, entity-class relationships, boundary-control diagrams, aswell as sequence/communication/class diagrams to showcase my understanding of OOP principles.
