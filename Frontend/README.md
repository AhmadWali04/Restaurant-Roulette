# Frontend Schematics

This repo holds all front end files for Restaurant Roulettte.





## Languages Used & Schematics
The front end is built off of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

The website landing page uses a very modern design developed in Figma to help appeal to a younger audience of enthusiastic foodies.

The front end will first ask users to sign up and create an account, creating an instance of the "User" object for the backend.

After creating an account, users are allowed to set preferences and query for search results, where the front end will pass off its work to the back end.

Once the backend is done search for results, the front end has the ability to read from the database and display user history/favourites.
